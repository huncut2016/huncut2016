### Hi there 👋
My name is András Zoller! I am a very ambitious 19-year-old student, who wants to be either a data scientist or a researcher.
My holy grail is making the world more livable and easier. Not least, my philosophy is rooted in open-source software, 
therefore I love 🐧[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning in high school
