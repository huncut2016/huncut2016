### Hi there 👋
My name is András Zoller! I am a very ambitious 18-year-old student, who wants to be either a data scientist or a researcher.
My holy grail is making the world more livable and easier. Not least, my philosophy is rooted in open-source software, 
therefore I love 🐧[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [BRANEN](https://github.com/huncut2016/branen)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in high school
- 📫 How to reach me: <zoller.andras2005@gmail.com>
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love literature and cultural arguments. In addition, one of my biggest hobbies is [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge).
